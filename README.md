# Password-Generator
 
## Description
This project is a random password generator, it asks you a series of questions about how you want your password to be made. Taking the user's input on how many characters long the password will be and will ask if you want any special characters, capital letters, and, numbers included. I built this because I want to get a better understanding of using javascript to make a webpage more interactive instead of only using CSS to style a page. I learned that by using javascript I can have a user interact with the page in more than just pressing a button.
